DESCRIPTION

    I frelling hate these things, but several releases in, I found myself
    needing to keep my dist.ini stuff in sync, which requires a single
    module to bind them to.

NAMING SCHEME

    I'm a strong believer in structured order in the chaos that is the CPAN
    namespace. There's enough cruft in CPAN, with all of the forked
    modules, legacy stuff that should have been removed 10 years ago, and
    confusion over which modules are available vs. which ones actually
    work. (Which all stem from the same base problem, so I'm almost
    repeating myself...)

    Like I said, I hate writing these personalized modules on CPAN. I even
    bantered around the idea of using MetaCPAN's author JSON input
    <https://github.com/SineSwiper/Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-BeLike-You/blob/
    master/BeLike-You.pod> to store the plugin data. However, keeping the
    Author plugins separated from the real PluginBundles is a step in the
    right direction. See KENTNL's comments on the Author namespace for more
    information.

CAVEATS

    This uses Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Merged, so all of the
    plugins' arguments are available, using Merged's rules. Special care
    should be made with arguments that might not be unique with other
    plugins. (Eventually, I'll throw these into config_rename.)

    If this is a problem, you might want to consider using @Filter.

    One exception is x_IRC, which is detected and passed to MetaResources
    properly.

SEE ALSO

    In building my ultimate dist.ini file, I did a bunch of research on
    which modules to cram in here. As a result, this is a pretty large set
    of plugins, but that's exactly how I like my DZIL. Feel free to
    research the modules listed here, as there's a bunch of good modules
    that you might want to include in your own dist.ini and/or Author
    bundle.
